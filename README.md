A program that allows users to insert an address and return criminal statistics based on the neighborhood.
This will provide a general idea of crime rate, and a statistical analysis if the neighborhood criminal 
activity has increased or decreased over time.

Users can also create an account, affiliate with a neighborhood, and communicate with others in the same neighborhood.

How to use the app :

To run the application, you will need to login through an interface.

Once you are loged in, you will have access to a search bar for the address you want to look.

Once you click on "search", you will have the criminal rate showing up on your screen with a symbol saying if the rate is growing, staying consistent or decreasing.

Once you are logged in, you'll also be able to contact the other people in your neighnorhood.
