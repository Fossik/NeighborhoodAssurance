A program that allows users to complete a search by inputing a state and a range of years. It returns criminal statistics based on the search parameters mentioend. This will provide a general idea of crime rate, and a statistical analysis if the neighborhood criminal activity has increased or decreased over time.

Users can also create an account, affiliate with a neighborhood, and communicate with others in the same neighborhood.

How to use the app :

Anyone can conduct a search without creating an account.
Once a user enters a valid address and clicks on "GO!", you will have the criminal rate showing up on your screen with a symbol saying if the rate is growing, staying consistent or decreasing.

To communicate with other neighbors:
You will need to login through an interface.

Once you are logged in, you can specify your neighborhood by providing the information asked.

Once you are logged in, you'll also be able to contact the other people in your neighborhood.
