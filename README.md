# NeighborhoodAssurance

A program that allows users to insert an address and return criminal statistics based on the neighborhood.
This will provide a general idea of crime rate, and a statistical analysis if the neighborhood criminal 
activity has increased or decreased over time.

Users can also create an account, affiliate with a neighborhood, and communicate with others in the same neighborhood.
