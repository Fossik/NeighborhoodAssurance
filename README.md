A program that allows users to insert an address and return criminal statistics based on the neighborhood. This will provide a general idea of crime rate, and a statistical analysis if the neighborhood criminal activity has increased or decreased over time.

Users can also create an account, affiliate with a neighborhood, and communicate with others in the same neighborhood.

How to use the app :

Anyone can search for an address without creating an account.
Once you enter a valid address and click on "search", you will have the criminal rate showing up on your screen with a symbol saying if the rate is growing, staying consistent or decreasing.

To communicate with other neighbors:
You will need to login through an interface.

Once you are logged in, you can specify your neighborhood by providing the information asked.

Once you are logged in, you'll also be able to contact the other people in your neighborhood.
