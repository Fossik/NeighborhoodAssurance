A program that allows users to insert an address and return criminal statistics based on the neighborhood. This will provide a general idea of crime rate, and a statistical analysis if the neighborhood criminal activity has increased or decreased over time.

Users can also create an account, affiliate with a neighborhood, and communicate with others in the same neighborhood.

How to use the app :

The first step will be Create An account. (in development)

Once you are connected, you can search an address, and it will show you the criminal rate.(in development)

The showing of the rate will be paired with a symbol saying if the rate is growing, staying consistent or decreasing.(in development)
